@title[Introduction]
- The Fe catalyst (Fe3+–N–C) was prepared through the pyrolysis of Fe-doped zinc (Zn) 2-methylimidazolate framework (ZIF-8) under N2 at 900 C
- The precursor adopts the same crystal structure as that of undoped ZIF-8, with a mole ratio of Fe:Zn of 4:96
- Fe ions occupy Zn sites and are coordinated by four pyrrolic-type nitrogens (N), as revealed by the fitting of the Fe K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum

For as yet unclear reasons, the HOR/HER kinetics on Pt are much slower in alkaline than in acid electrolytes.

### Our hypothesis
The pH-dependence of the HBE is from change of water adsorption due to the change of applied potential.

---
Difference in pH at RHE scale is the difference in potential at SHE scale.

Simulate the interface from explicit simulation:  

- <span style="font-size: 0.4em">At pH 0.2 (HClO4), the experiment Hupd peak of Pt(100) appears at about 0.3 V.</span>  
- <span style="font-size: 0.4em">At pH 5.2 (Acetate buffer), the experiment Hupd peak of Pt(100) appears at about 0.25 V.</span>  
- <span style="font-size: 0.4em">At pH 12.8 (KOH), the experiment Hupd peak of Pt(100) appears at about 0.4 V.</span>  

Thus the voltage we interested with are:  
<span style="font-size: 0.4em"> 4.4 + 0.30 -  0.2 x 0.0592 = 4.69;</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em"> 4.4 + 0.25 -  5.2 x 0.0592 = 4.34;</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em"> 4.4 + 0.40 - 12.8 x 0.0592 = 4.04;</span>  
<span style="font-size: 0.4em">set 1: 4.69 to 4.04;</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em">set 2: 4.89 to 4.24;</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em">set 3: 4.40, 3.98, 3.57</span>

simulation results:  
<span style="font-size: 0.4em">00e: 5.0;</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em">10e: 4.0;</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em">20e: 3.0</span>
