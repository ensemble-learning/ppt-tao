@title[Introduction]
Hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) are two of the key processes in renewable energy conversion and storage devices

---
For as yet unclear reasons, the HOR/HER kinetics on Pt are much slower in alkaline than in acid electrolytes.

### Some explainations
- <span style="font-size: 0.6em">Faster formation of H* from H plus than from H2O. (Strmcnik et al. Nano Energy, 2016) </span>
- <span style="font-size: 0.6em">The pH dependence of entropy change from the proton transfer from the bulk solution into the outer Helmholz layer. (Rossmeisl et al. Catalysis Today, 2016)</span>
- <span style="font-size: 0.6em">Partial oxidation of water adsorption on step sites of metals (Schwarz et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2016)</span>
- <span style="font-size: 0.6em">Weakened OH adsorption strength induced by the co-adsorption of cation (McCrum et al. J. Phys. Chem. C, 2016)</span>

---
### Our hypothesis
The pH-dependence of the HBE is from change of water adsorption energy
